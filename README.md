# CS244 Spring 2019 - Project 2
Peter Spradling, Jerry Zhilin Jiang

## Introduction
Reproduction of the [On Inferring TCP Behavior](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tbit.pdf) paper [Padhye, Floyd 2001].

Project specification: <http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs244/pa2.html>

## How to Run
To run the experiment, simply open up a Mac OSX terminal, go to the repo's root directory (using `cd`), and execute the following shell script:
```
sudo bash ./run.sh
```
Note that you might be prompted to enter the admin password one or more times during script execution.

The experiment results will be printed to the very end of the `stdout` outputs.
